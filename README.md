# Deep-Learning-KERAS
How neural networks feed data forward through the network. The gradient descent algorithm and how variables are optimized with respect to a defined function. Backpropagation and how neural networks learn and update their weights and biases. The vanishing gradient problem. Activation Functions. Deep learning libraries namely, Keras, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. Building a regression model using the Keras library. Building a classification model using the Keras library. The difference between the shallow and deep neural networks. Convolutional networks and how to build them using the Keras library. Recurrent Neural Networks. Autoencoders and how to build them using the Keras library.

## 1. Artificial Neural Networks
- **Forward Propagation**:  I built a neural network from scratch and code how it performs predictions using forward propagation.

## 2. Models with Keras
- **Regression Model**: Making Regression Neural Model using Keras and predicing data
